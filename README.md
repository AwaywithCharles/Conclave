# Conclave

**Conclave** is a repository for documenting my university work, self-study learning projects, and other projects. The projects in this repository are primarily for my personal learning and growth, as well as to serve as a form of portfolio to showcase my capabilities and are not intended for collaboration or contributions from others, but I am always open to feedback and constructive criticism.

Thank you for your interest in Conclave, and I hope that you find these projects informative and helpful in your own learning journey. Unless otherwise stated, everything within this repo falls under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International licensing.   If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.
