Besides the code functionality and organization, a hiring manager may also consider the following factors when reviewing your code:

Readability: Ensure that your code is easy to read and understand. Use meaningful variable and method names, follow consistent indentation and formatting conventions, and provide comments where necessary to explain complex logic or algorithms.

Error handling: Demonstrate good error handling practices by anticipating and handling potential exceptions or invalid input. Display informative error messages to the user when input validation fails or unexpected errors occur.

Performance: Although performance may not be a critical factor for a small-scale application like this, it's still worth considering. If you have identified any areas where performance optimizations can be made without sacrificing code readability, it may be beneficial to implement those improvements.



Can you help me implement and  add javadoc documentations and high-level comments for the classes to describe the purpose and functionality of the program. This is to helps provide context for readers who may be reviewing the code, more specifically, this documentation is going to be implemented for when hiring managers and software engineers review my code to evaluate me as a potential candidate for their company. 

Here is the top of the code.

/**
 * Purpose of Program: This program provides distance and temperature conversion utilities through a graphical user interface.
 * Author: Charles Bostwick
 * Date: June 22, 2023

Here is the SRS for helping write documentation. 

# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Project: Demonstrate GUI & Polymorphism

## 1. Introduction

The GUI & Polymorphism project aims to develop a Java program that includes a GUI interface and implements a converter class hierarchy. The program allows users to convert values between different modes, such as temperature and distance. The GUI interface enhances the program's user-friendliness but is separate from the core functionality of performing conversions.

## 2. Converter Class Hierarchy

### 2.1 Converter Class

The Converter class serves as the parent class for specific converter classes and includes the following:
- A private attribute for the input, representing a data type of double.
- A default constructor with no parameters that sets the input to Double.NaN (Not a Number).
- An overloaded constructor with an input parameter.
- A method named convert() that returns the input value.

### 2.2 TemperatureConverter Class

The TemperatureConverter class is a child class of Converter and includes the following:
- Constructors that call the parent constructors.
- An overridden convert() method that converts the input Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius using the formula: C = ((F-32) * 5)/9.
- If the instance has no input value or the input is not a number, it should return Double.NaN.

### 2.3 DistanceConverter Class

The DistanceConverter class is a child class of Converter and includes the following:
- Constructors that call the parent constructors.
- An overridden convert() method that converts the input distance in miles to kilometers using the formula: KM = M * 1.609.
- If the instance has no input value or the input is not a number, it should return Double.NaN.

## 3. GUIConverter Class

The GUIConverter class should be implemented using JFrame and JPanel to create a graphical user interface. The GUI should have the following features:
- The window should be centered on the computer screen.
- Three buttons: Distance, Temperature, and Exit.
- Clicking the Exit button terminates the program.
- Clicking the Distance button displays an input dialog where the user can type a value and click OK.
- Once the user clicks OK, a message dialog displays the result.
- After reviewing the result, clicking OK returns the program to the original window.
- Clicking the Temperature button displays an input dialog to input a value. After clicking OK, a message dialog pops up with the converted result.
- The window should be appropriately sized, with buttons of equal dimensions surrounded by a maximum of ¼ to ½ inch of space.

## 4. Main Method

The main method serves as the program's entry point and should include the following:
- Instantiation of the Converter class.
- Display of the GUI interface, either directly in the main method or called by another method.
- The GUI interface should consist of the two options (Temperature and Distance) and an Exit button.
- The main method should be minimal, with most of the coding implemented in separate methods outside the main method.

## 5. Style and Documentation

The Java program should follow recommended coding style practices, including meaningful variable names, proper spacing, and the use of comments for clarity and documentation.
- Javadoc comments should be provided at the beginning of the program, including the author's name, date, and a brief program description.
- Comments should be used to describe variables and code blocks, following the documentation guidelines provided in Week 1.
- Class names should be written in upper CamelCase, and constants should be written in all capitals.
