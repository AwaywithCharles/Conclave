# Book Inventory in Java

This project showcases my proficiency in Java programming and software development. It consists of a Book Inventory program that allows users to manage a list of books. The program provides functionalities for adding, removing, finding, and displaying books in the inventory. 

## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

The SRS document provides a detailed description of the project's requirements, design constraints, and system behavior. It outlines the functional and non-functional requirements necessary for the successful development and implementation of the Book Inventory program. The SRS serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the project's scope and objectives.

To view the complete Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, please refer to the [SRS.md](SRS.md) file in this repository.

## Java Implementation

The Java implementation of the Book Inventory program consists of two classes: `CMIS242ASG1BostwickC` and `Book`. These classes work together to provide the desired functionalities.

The `CMIS242ASG1BostwickC` class serves as the main driver for the program. It manages the book inventory using an `ArrayList` and provides a user-friendly interface through a menu system. The class includes methods to add a book, remove a book, find a book, and display all books in the inventory. It also includes error handling to ensure proper program execution.

The `Book` class represents a book with attributes such as ID, title, and price. It includes a constructor to initialize these attributes and getter methods to access them. Additionally, it provides a method to display the book's information.

To view the complete Java implementation, please refer to the [BookInventorySystem.java](BookInventorySystem.java) file in this repository.

## Usage

To run the Book Inventory program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

2. Compile the `BookInventorySystem.java` file using the following command: javac BookInventorySystem.java

3. Run the compiled file using the following command: java BookInventorySystem

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the Book Inventory program.

## Requirements

To run the Book Inventory program, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)

## Notes

- The implementation provided in the `BookInventorySystem.java` file is a partial implementation based on the specified requirements in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS). Additional code may be required to ensure the program works as intended and meets all requirements.
- The project adheres to recommended coding style practices, including meaningful variable names, proper spacing, and the use of comments for clarity and documentation.
- Proper error handling is implemented to handle incorrect input or invalid book IDs provided by the user.
- The project includes documentation in the form of Javadoc comments and comments for variables and code blocks.
